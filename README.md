Hi, welcome to my clone of Tumblr, called Rumblr.

https://rumblr.net

Exploring Rumblr is easy. Follow the link below. The form is pre-filled
with a guest account. Simply click Log in. You can also make your own account
by navigating to the Sign up page.

Rumblr will automatically log you out after 2 hours. Simply log back in if you weren't
done exploring Rumblr.

I originally created this application at the time to both practice as well as demonstrate my web development skills. I've grown a lot
as a developer since then, and if you examine the code you will see the code of a much more junior developer. However,
I still fully stand behind this project and believe it was completely successful in its mission, which was to faithfully
and accurately clone the UI/UX of Tumblr.

Anyways I hope you enjoy!
